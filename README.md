# Overview

The game is based off a game called "Greed" The purpose of the game is to collect gems for points and avoid rocks. If you collect a rock you lose a point, while collecting a gem gains you a point. In my version the "gems" are circles while the "rocks" are squares. There is a point counter in the bottom left of the window that tells the user how many points they have. The game goes on until the user closes the window. 


The purpose of writing this softare is to demonstrate skill in game framework. I had to learn how to use pygame and tkinter for this program and implement the various elements in order to produce a working game. 


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
